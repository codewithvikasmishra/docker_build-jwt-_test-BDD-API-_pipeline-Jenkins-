Errors which I Faced are as below: -
1) 'jwt' has no attribute 'encode' in api.py
2) When I remove encode from code then it was giving another error that 'str' object has no 'decode'
 in api.py.

Why I faced above two errors and solution: -
When I ran the entire code of api.py without docker then it was working fine (Also checked on
POSTMAN testing tool with http://127.0.0.1/5000/login) but when I have shifted to docker then
I get to know that algorithm needs to be passed in encode and decode both.

3) How to make 2 conatiners in single docker-compose file for development_jwt and test_jwt.

Solution: -
We need to make docker-compose file with two services and needs to pass different ports for both.
Also, we need to know build two different docker files (Dockerfiles we can built by name of
Dockerfileand if we need to make more than one Dockerfile then we need to built Dockerfile.build
and Dockerfile.test in such way)

4) On which port falsk will run.

Solution: -
I have used EXPOSE 5000 in my Docker.build file and also in docker-compose file I used port
as 5000:5000

5) api.py cann't import

Solution: -
As per my folder structure I need to copy the workdirectory in Dockerfile.build as . /jwt/app and
in docker-compose file voulmes should be /jwt only for development_jwt container.

6) How to run the development_jwt Dockerfile and cconatiner.

Solution: -
We need to pass the ENV and CMD in dockerfile as below: -
ENV FLASK_APP=api.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
CMD ["flask","run"]

So in such way we are saying that flask api.py needs to run first at localhost.

7) "exec:\BASH\: executable file not found in $PATH: Unknown for test_jwt container.

Solution: -
Now the problem is how to run the test_jwt and it should be run after when development_jwt
conatiner started (because then only pytest can work) so I added
    depends_on: 
      - development_jwt
in docker-compose file. Then the problem is why its sending error of
["exec:\BASH\: executable file not found in $PATH: Unknown] so I used entrypoint in my
docker-compose run command as below: -
docker-compose run --entrypoint=bash test_jwt run_tests.sh

In the above command first I was using bash in uppercase (BASH) which again throwing same error that
executable file not found. So, please use bash in lower case only.

8) Connection error (refused to connect) in test_jwt.

Solution: -
I was giving the API link as localhost:5000/login which doesn't work here because my development_jwt
is running on 172.18.0.1 (you can find it when you will run the docker-compose up command and try
any API on postman then you will see something like below: - 
development_jwt   | 172.18.0.1 - - [12/Feb/2021 08:57:29] "GET /login HTTP/1.1" 200 -).

We need to provide ip address of Docker to test the API's.
